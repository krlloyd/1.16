Augments are NBT-based, meaning you can assign any modifiers and values you want by modifying item NBT. In other words, there's nothing special about the augments that Thermal provides - literally any item can be an augment, assuming it has the relevant NBT data.

Although the augment type (machine, dynamo, potion, etc) does not currently affect anything (at the time of writing), it will be used for validation purposes in the future. Modifiers are assigned to an item through attribute-value pairs, the attribute being the modifier type and the value being the modifier value. All values are floats, even if the modifier type suggests it should be integral (e.g. potion strength)."    },    {      "type": "link",      "url": "https://github.com/KingLemming/1.16/blob/master/CoFHCore/src/main/java/cofh/core/util/constants/NBTTags.java#L85",      "link_text": "Github Link",      "text": "The general form of the NBT is as follows: $(br2){AugmentData:$(br){Type:'[augment type]',$(br)[modifier 1]:[float value]f, $(br)[modifier 2]:[float value]f, $(br)[...]}}$(br2)A full list of available augment types and modifiers can be found in King Lemming's Github; link below.
